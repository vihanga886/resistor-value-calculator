# Resistor Value Calculator

## Introduction
Welcome to the Resistor Value Calculator! This tool is designed to help you easily determine the resistance value of resistors with 4 color bands. Written in C, this program simplifies the process of reading and calculating resistor values, making it an essential tool for electronics enthusiasts and professionals alike.

## Features
- **Accurate Calculation**: Determines resistor values based on the standard 4-band color code.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive command-line interface.

## How to Use
1. **Enter Color codes**: Enter the colors of the 4 bands on the resistor according to the given way.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).

## Usage
### 1.Run with Code::Blocks or VS Code
Just run as the usual way.
### 2.Run with cmd
1. **Compile the Program**:
    ```sh
    gcc -o resistorCalc.c -o resistorCalc.exe
    ```
2. **Run the Program**:
    ```sh
    resistorCalc.exe
    ```
3. **Follow the Prompts**: Enter the colors of the resistor bands as prompted.
